<h2 class="chapter">Chapter Two</h2> 
  <h1>Dwarfs</h1>

<p>Very well, then. And so it shall be!</p>
<p>But always check in with your energy.</p>
<br>
<p>As from here to the South Pole and farther up north, </p>
<p>You’ll still come across a struggling dwarf. </p>
<br>
<p>During the night, when submerged in his dream, </p>
<p>A dwarf emanates such a radiant gleam. </p>
<br>
<p>Snoring, he hangs from a tree, upside down, </p>
<p>But what if he does so with passionate frown?</p>
<br>
<p>Take care not to wake him, but from down below, </p>
<p>Whisper, ‘Oh Dwarfy, why glow you so?’</p>
<br>
<p>The answer will come to you per intuition, </p>
<p>And you will help bring Dwarfy’s dream to fruition!</p>
<img id="dwarf-img" src="./images/dwarf.svg"/>
<p>It is much like where we live; what humans should know:</p>
<p>A dwarf needs to see a direction to go.</p>
<br>
<p>It is not that he’s run out of positive visions, </p>
<p>But that Dwarfland just keeps weighing down his ambitions. </p>
<br>
<p>And the mountain that once was the dwarfs’ sacred home</p>
<p>Was restructured to serve as their enemies’ dome.</p>
<br>
<p>Dwarfy called onto Yahweh, “Oh almighty Sir,</p>
<p>Are you partial or what to allow such a stir?</p>
<br>
<p>Yes, I know that I failed to give praise to each bee,</p>
<p>But I hereby dismiss this old contract with Thee.”</p>
<img id="dwarf-img-2" src="./images/yachwe.svg"/>
<p>So the dwarfs crossed through marshlands with slippery stones</p>
<p>To a moor where there’s peace and the trees look like bones.</p>
<br>
<p>Then a dwarf raised his hand and announced to the crew:</p>
<p>“I think that these trees for our beds will just do.”</p>
<br>
<p>They install themselves hanging, and during the night</p>
<p>Something comes through that is lucid and bright:</p>
<br>
<p>A dreamworld battlefield of some kind</p>
<p>Where you fight so as to get your purpose aligned. </p>
<br>
<p>You'll approach him like this: “You’ve been wronged, now you’re found,</p>
<p>But how long does it take for a change to come round!</p>
<br>
<p>“I have one older sister; she is strong in her heart</p>
<p>And I’m sure she would tell you the ways of her art.”</p>
<br>
<p>Now what intuition comes to you?</p>
<p>Why's Dwarfy’s heart so clenched and blue?</p>

<div class="opt3" id="wrong1">“Heck, you just woke me out of a hot fever. Standing on an island, I was sleighing beasts all around me as they crawled out of the sea, ready to eat me. There was no end to their number! And I was getting weaker and weaker by the minute, hardly able to hold my head above my bones. This must have been hell!”</div>
<a id="anchor3" href = "./part-four.html"><div class="opt3" id="right3">“Well, that was quite something. I haven’t felt so peaceful in a long time. First, I was experiencing all sorts of strange and highly uncomfortable emotions. Then I was seized by a warm, golden light and felt terribly happy. Then a vision came through: The woods around the sacred mountain we once called our home were haunted! I never ventured out at night. Could this be? I think we should look for a cave somewhere around here instead.”</div></a>
<div class="opt3" id="wrong2">Dwarfy is sleeping. This is a sensitive time, do not interrupt. His shine is his own private affair; he doesn’t like being exposed. Why don’t you go look for something else to do.</div>
<div class="opt3" id="wrong3">Dwarfy has no idea what just happened. Nor does he know if he’s excited or anxious, woke or insane. The battlefield was rampaging. The commanders were all hanging out in their tents, having themselves a good time, while the rest was trying to ward off demons who were fighting them for no other reason than wanting to give them a hard time. They even stole their sandwiches from the food pantry. Keeping up his defense, Dwarfy was laughing and crying hysterically because the whole scene was so pointless.</div>
