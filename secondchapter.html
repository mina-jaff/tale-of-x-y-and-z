<p>So that’s what you say; dragons ought to adapt?</p>
<p>That they better fly sweating while the new world is mapped?</p>
<br>

<p>So rush down through the forest, and then dropping your sword,</p>
<p>From a bush, you’ll call “Is this the New World Resort?</p>
<br>

<p>“I have come with good manners, and with pure intent:</p>
<p>Let’s reduce our emissions to help out a huge friend.”</p>
<br>

<p>What, dear friend, upon that day,</p>
<p>Do you think these friends will say?</p>

<div class="parent-opts">
<div id="opt2">"Nay is nay."
</div>
<div id="opt2">"Well, okay."
</div>
<div id="opt2">“We’ve heard of you. Heroic one day, depressed the next. Why should we trust you? We’re kind of comfortable here in our resort. The motto of this resort is: Shall new be as old! Pick up your sword and try to convince us otherwise!”</div>
