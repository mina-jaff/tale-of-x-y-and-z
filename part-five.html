<h2 class="chapter">Chapter Three</h2> 
  <h1>Fairies</h1>
  <p>So they’re doing their work, and we call you once more
</p>
  <p>To move northbound where more regret comes to the shore
</p>
  <br>
    <p>In an unlikely place that is known everywhere</p>
    <p>For its mystical creatures with beautiful hair
</p>
  <br>
    <p>Where a fallen fairy wanes on the ground, 
</p>
    <p>As there is something so shocking she found. 
</p>
  <br>
    <p>One minute, Great Fairy was gaily afloat, 
</p>
    <p>Then overheard an anecdote
</p>
    <p>Hissed by some creatures shrouded in fog
</p>
    <p>In a secret circle behind a log. 
</p>
  <img id="fairy-img" src="./images/fee.svg"/>

    <p>It was said that her brothers were paying no heed
</p>
    <p>To stomping on moss with their oversized feet. 
</p>
  <br>
    <p>Well, the moss is a fairy woodland’s pride, 
</p>
    <p>And a place where some friends of the fairies reside. 
</p>
  <br>
    <p>Dismayed, she shook her head so hard,
</p>
    <p>She came down and gave in to the pang in her heart. 
</p>
  <br>
    <p>With an herbal potion and a clear-sighted notion, 
</p>
    <p>You could show the Great Fairy your fearless devotion. 
</p>
  <br>
    <p>Since fairies are born with such sensitive skin, 
</p>
    <p>They have warrior schools to build strength from within. 
</p>
  <br>
    <p>But, you know, even in a warrior’s game
</p>
    <p>Something can happen that binds like a chain.</p>
  <br>
    <p>When her teacher suggested a practice to do,</p>
    <p>For weeks she pretended, “I’m down with the flu.”
</p>
  <br>
    <p>If you moan, “c’mon Fairy, it’s not a big deal”,
</p>
    <p>You should know that it pinched at deep wounds yet to heal.</p>
  <br>
    <p>While now, among fairies, she knows great respect,
</p>
    <p>Her childhood was marked by rebuke and neglect. 
</p>
  <br>
    <p>But eventually, surely, Great Fairy will rise
</p>
    <p>Once you tug at her gown and call grieving’s demise. 
</p>
  <br>
    <p>So ask her, “Great Fairy, what do you need?
</p>
    <p>I have wits and a wig and two tread-upon feet
</p>
    <p>That have marched all these miles to leave sorrow behind
</p>
    <p>And to meet you today as this sorrowful find.
</p>
  <br>
      <p>“In my bag, there’s perspective and hope and a tool
</p>
    <p>That drills through old soil and then makes it a pool
</p>
  <br>
      <p>“And you’re welcome to bathe in the stuff that spills out
</p>
    <p>That is silver and cures every unwelcome drought.”
</p>
  <br>
      <p></p>
    <p></p>
  <br>

  <div class="parent-opts">

<div class="opt5" id="wrong1">“I’d just like to know why you’re wearing a wig, for your head is too small and your hair is too big.” 

</div>
<div class="opt5" id="wrong2">“Young friend, adventurous as you are, there are things we don’t know, and we've both walked too far.”  
</div>
<a id="anchor5" href = "./final.html"><div class="opt5" id="right5">“My head is like tar and my feet are like air; open your bag, let me see what is there.” 
</div></a>
<div class="opt5" id="wrong3">“I’ll have chicken for breakfast and chickpeas for lunch, and I’ll wash it all down with some old chocolate crunch.”
