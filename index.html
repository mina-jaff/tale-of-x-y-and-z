  <h2 class="chapter">Chapter One</h2> 
  <h1>Dragons</h1>
  <p>The planet is warming,  
</p> 
  <p>and so is the air,
</p> 
  <p>which causes a flying dragon despair.</p> 
  <br>
  <p>It’s humid and steamy in highest height, 
</p> 
  <p>as dragons launch into noble flights.
</p> 
  <br>
  <p>They have beings to rescue and to defend; 
</p> 
  <p>Now imagine in what pool of sweat they descend!
</p> 
  <br>
  <p>And during the last year, to add to the task, 
</p> 
  <p>Their breathing was stifled by a great mask. 
</p> 
<img id="first-dragon-img" src="./images/dragon.svg"/>
  <p>Sticky with liquid spit out by their pores,
</p> 
  <p>It’s a lot more demanding to keep up with chores.</p> 
  <br>
  <p>A flying dragon, who’s focused and clear, 
</p> 
  <p>Cannot use fatigue as he cuts through the air.
</p> 
  <br>
<p>But when there is nothing and no one to blame, 
</p>
<p>He draws on his will and can step up his game. 
</p>
  <br>
<p>He knows, if he hovers complaining at best, 
</p>
<p>He’ll land in a lake and disturb old Loch Ness. 
</p>
  <br>
<p>And now, worthy player, for them to succeed, 
</p>
<p>It is you who is asked to help out meet their need. 
</p>
  <br>
<p>We heard that your virtue’s your brain in your skull,
</p>
<p>That a bend of the mind is to you still quite dull,
</p>
  <br>
<p>That your deeds are well-known and your mission is big, 
</p>
<p>That you work undercover in coat and a wig.
</p>
  <br>
<p>You’ve erected a pillar to shout from atop
</p>
<p>That this world has become like the bull’s china shop! 
</p>
  <br>
<p>Yet one day, you were helpless with no help in sight,
</p>
<p>So you quit and turned bitter, and did so with pride.
</p>
  <br>
<p>While the cornfield was brushed, you just stood in the wind,
</p>
<p>Sickly waiting for someone to give you a hint.
</p>
  <img id="cornfield-img" src="./images/cornfield.svg"/>
<p>As the time has drawn near, now proceed with your quest,
</p>
<p>Since we know, for this purpose, you’re simply the best.
</p>
  <br>
<p>Why, it sure isn’t easy to do this alone – 
</p>
<p>But with us in your corner, you’ll build a new Rome.
</p>
  <br>
<p>And now that we meet, here’s a thing we must know: 
</p>
<p>How does a sleigh glide when we’ve run out of snow? 
</p>

  <div class="parent-opts">
<a id="anchor1" href = "./part-two.html"><div class="opt1" id="right1">By adapting to the texture and structure of the substance it glides through.</div></a>
<div class="opt1" id="wrong1">What does that have to do with anything?</div>
<div class="opt1" id="wrong2">It doesn’t. It’s time to set all sleighs on fire and mourn as we spread their ashes.</div>
<div class="opt1" id="wrong3">I don’t have time for stupid questions. People like you who ask questions like yours are the reason I quit my work. 
</div>
<div class="opt1" id="wrong4">When there’s no more snow, I’d say sleighs have become redundant. We must turn to surfboards, skateboards and skies.
