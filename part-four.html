<p>Dwarfy leaps down as if struck by a stick, 
</p>
<p>Exclaiming, “Sweet Jesus, let’s set to work quick!
</p>
<br>
<p>“When I’m not like a lion, I am just like a sheep – 
</p>
<p>While I stand around bleating, my posture is meek.
</p>
<br>
<p>“Yet this ground feels like velvet, 
</p>
<p>and my heart, it can sing –
</p>
<br>
<p>So while building our kingdom
</p>
<p>I shall shed this old skin!
</p>
<br>
<p>“Now as for your sister, let her teach what she can!
</p>
<p>As our priestess she will show what’s concealed to a man!
</p>
<br>
<p>"Like a mud-covered lily! Lo and behold!
</p>
<p>Like she blossoms, so too will our hearts unfold!
</p>
<br>
<p>“Our walls will be steady, and so will our core – 
</p>
<p>But wait, what was it we're striving for?”
</p>

<div class="opt4" id="wrong1">We want to build a castle of sand that blows with the wind, just like the wind. That way we won’t be bound to the tricky laws of the earth.

<div class="opt4" id="wrong2">I forget. Let’s take a break. We got a little caught up in our excitement, but I have a suspicion that our plans are futile. 
</div>
<div class="opt4" id="wrong3">We’re striving to build a pompous castle with everlasting barricades to intimidate our enemies. Those smug idiots.
